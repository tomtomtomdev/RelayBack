# RelayBack — Progress Log

> Source of truth for "where are we." Written to survive context clears. Update this at the
> end of every slice (see `CLAUDE.md` → "Ending a slice"). Newest note at the top of the log.

## Current state

- **Phase:** implementation. **S0 done** — app builds, tests pass, launches as a menu-bar
  agent. UI design handoff (`RelayBack.zip` → HTML + README) is the S10 reference.
- **Next slice:** **S1 — TOTP core** (pure, TDD; RFC 6238 Appendix B vectors). See `PLAN.md`.
- **Blockers / open questions:** none. (Future-phase items parked in SPEC §10.)

## Decisions & deviations

_(Record anything that differs from or sharpens SPEC.md / PLAN.md, with a one-line why.)_

- 2026-06-30 — Design locked: allowlist-only execution, TOTP arm/disarm, personal local
  (non-sandboxed) install. Build split into TDD slices S0–S11.
- 2026-07-01 — S0: **Sandbox disabled** (`ENABLE_APP_SANDBOX = NO`) — required so `Process`
  can spawn (SPEC §8 / invariant I4). `RelayBack.entitlements` (app-sandbox=false) lives at
  `RelayBack/Resources/` and is verified *not* bundled into the .app.
- 2026-07-01 — S0: Deployment target lowered `15.6 → 14.0` to match SPEC's stated macOS 14 floor.
- 2026-07-01 — S0: **Empty module folders are NOT kept in git.** The project uses Xcode 16
  file-system-synchronized groups (`objectVersion 77`): every file under `RelayBack/` is
  auto-added to the target, and placeholder files (even `.gitkeep`) get copied to
  `Contents/Resources/`, colliding as duplicate outputs → build fails. So `Core/`, `Telegram/`,
  `Execution/`, `Storage/`, `Features/Settings/` are created *lazily* when their slice adds a
  real source file. Do **not** add `.gitkeep`/placeholder files to satisfy folder structure.
- 2026-07-01 — S0: Bundle id left as template default `com.RelayBack` (no reverse-DNS org).
  Change before any distribution; irrelevant for local v1.

## Log

_(Append newest first: date — slice — what got done, what's next, snags.)_

- 2026-07-01 — S0 complete. Converted stock template → menu-bar agent: `App/RelayBackApp.swift`
  (`MenuBarExtra`, `.window` style), `Features/MenuBar/MenuBarRootView.swift` (S0 placeholder,
  full popover deferred to S10). Removed `ContentView.swift`. Set `LSUIElement=YES`, sandbox off,
  entitlements, min macOS 14. Verified: `xcodebuild build` + `test` green (`bootstrapSmoke`
  passes), built .app has `LSUIElement=true` / min 14.0 / app-sandbox=false, launches as a
  menu-bar icon with no Dock icon and quits cleanly. **Next: S1 — TOTP core.**
- 2026-06-30 — Created SPEC.md, PLAN.md, CLAUDE.md, and seeded this PROGRESS.md. Ready to
  begin S0.
